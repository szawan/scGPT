Version 1.16
=============

Bug fixes:
  
  o AR and RANLIB programs used to compile R are now also used to compile
  the HDF5 library. This resolves issue when the default versions found on a
  system are incompatible with options used to build R.
  (thanks to @miesav, https://github.com/grimbough/Rhdf5lib/pull/41)
  o Fixed issue in Windows installation introduced by upstream changes
  to libcurl distributed by rwinlibs.

Version 1.14
=============

New features:

  o Updated internal version of HDF5 to 1.10.7

Bug fixes:
  
  o CPPFLAGS used to build R are now used during HDF compilation.
  o Package configure script will now stop if it encounters errors when 
  compiling HDF5.  This should make diagnosing issues easier.

Version 1.8
=============

New features:

  o Updated internal version of HDF5 to 1.10.5

Bug fixes:
  
  o Quote paths reported by pkgconfig() to allow installation in libraries 
  with whitespace in the path.
  
Version 1.0
=============

New features:

  o Updated internal version of HDF5 to 1.8.19

Bug fixes:
  
  o Switched Windows compilation script to use CMake rather than configure.
  This seems to have solved problems in opening multiple files using different
  access modes.
